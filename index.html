                        In order to provide a reliable and positive work environment, we designed this system to deploy
                        ultimate surveillance coverage,
                        helping security guards and managers to monitor and protect property of the company.

                    <p>
                        Before design this system, we did field study and qualitative research with security guards in
                        company to empathize their needs and pain points.
                        Then we invited stakeholders to join the small workshop to do ideation using value proposition
                        canvas.

                        Those information and resources became nutrients of our design. After several rounds of
                        discussions with each stakeholder and we also gave serious consideration
                        about the costs, time and technical feasibility. This surveillance platform is separated into
                        three parts: Central Control System (PC view & mobile view), Vendor System, and Permission
                        Setting.
                        We put a lot of effort into wireframes design to fulfill every scenario. The logic of flow, the
                        style of interface...each part of our design was done by iterations.

                        We cooperated with deep dive market team to analyze market data, and based on this quantitative
                        result we decided our target audience for qualitative research. In order to realize actual
                        situations and a work process, we visited dozens of animal hospitals from different locations
                        in Taiwan.
                        By interviews, questionnaires and other research methods, we received a lot of valuable and
                        unexpected information.

                        detection, medical treatment, information flow, and hospital environment.

                        Based on these four key findings, we did several rounds of brainstorming. Then we discussed
                        about the input and output of each idea to connect them and generate the comprehensive service.
                        We made the service blueprint to record this completed and thoughtful service. This blueprint
                        is not only showing us the whole picture of our service, but also is really helpful when we use
                        it to communicate with other technical teams.

                        Hospital infections and resistant germs are becoming a serious problem in whole Europe. To
                        fight against it has become a very important issue for the German government. We developed the
                        solution, MediClean, which offers a series of innovative services for improving hospital

                        one of the representatives of this industry to understand the role of each part in the medical
                        system. As we expected, a cleaning staff is the important stakeholder.
                        Then we did field research in hospitals of Berlin, Frankfurt and Daun. Based on our research,
                        the core issues of hospital hygiene include:
                        1. Time pressure and work-flow of cleaning staffs
                        2. Content of training program (qualification and knowledge)
                        3. Sense of belonging in team and language boundaries of cleaning staffs

                        culture is hard to deliver to tourists. And some stores nearby have no stable revenue sources.

                        At first, participants will receive the brochure (includes all routes we designed), and then
                        they can choose which story they want to join. By following the route, they would learn more
                        about tee culture and have chances to know special stores there (there are coupons in the
                        brochure too). After they finish their task, they will receive our secret presents.

                        Nowadays more and more people are too busy to ignore their body’s condition, especially
                        students who are not living at home. On the other hand, for this type of students there is a
                        distance between them and their family. We offer, therefore, opportunities that being healthy
                        and building the positive family connection.

                        Depends on our design research we found out sustainability of health promotion and the
                        alienation of family are two big problems.

                        After some discussions we decided to use “sense of participation” and “competition” to improve
                        problems we found. Moreover Family Tower not just enhance health promotion, but also use the
                        topic “Health” to strengthen the relationship of family.

                        for business success.” —Tim Brown, president and CEO

                        In 2011, five coaches from d.school (institute of design at Stanford) hosted a two-day workshop
                        in National Tsing Hua University to deliver the concept of Design Thinking. By these five
                        processes: Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, we learn Design thinking has come to be
                        defined as combining empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of
                        insights and solutions, and rationality in analyzing and fitting various solutions to the
                        problem context.
