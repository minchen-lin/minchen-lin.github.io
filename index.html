                        Since attackers have become more sophisticated, enterprises must turn to more advanced
                        detection and response capabilities.
                        However, an ordinary in-house IT team has no related expertise and most of small/midsize
                        enterprise only implement limited in security tools/staffs.
                        To close this gap, Trend Micro offers Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services, which
                        provide 24/7 monitoring, alerts correlation/prioritization, threat hunting/investigation, and
                        remediation plans.

                        In the early stage, we host an internal Value Proposition workshop to sync up our core values

                        And our output would be research materials for external validation that keep us on the right

                        Then I could plan long-term and short-term research topics with researchers. The capability of
                        time management is a must-have item. I should not only deliver wireframe on time but pay
                        attention to development progress.
                        To fit in the schedule, sometimes I need to compromise on the ideal solutions, but I would add
                        all UX gaps in the product backlogs and keep tracking them.

                        Although the operation team are spread across different countries (US, Philippines, Ireland…),
                        product team and I collect requirements/comments and validate design frequently by weekly

                        We also inserted some tracking code on the console for getting feedback of user behaviors.
                        Based on those resources, I could keep refining my design and ensure we deliver an useful and

                        Also, we collected real use cases from Gartner reports and internal/external interviews.
                        Then we did concept validation with customers by using wireframes I designed to make sure we
                        are on the right track.

                        The core value of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution is to display the root cause of
                        threat and provide a fluent flow to accelerate investigation and response.
                        After I've become the new main designer of this product, my mission is to clearly deliver that
                        value and enhance the usage experience.
                        Unlike the previous versions, which only focused on Hunter (type A users), in this new release
                        we would like to expand our targets of business to type B users as well.
                        Therefore, different from former presentations (the left-hand side of below image), I present a
                        simplified chain in the first layer, which can make these two types of users easily understand
                        the attack story.

                        This provides enough details and guidance for type A users and also some type B users who want
                        to learn how to do threat investigation.

                        in Taiwan.
                        By interviews, questionnaires and other research methods, we received a lot of valuable and
                        unexpected information.

                        Hospital infections and resistant germs are becoming a serious problem in whole Europe. To
                        fight against it has become a very important issue for the German government. We developed the
                        solution, MediClean, which offers a series of innovative services for improving hospital

                        system. As we expected, a cleaning staff is the important stakeholder.
                        Then we did field research in hospitals of Berlin, Frankfurt and Daun. Based on our research,
                        the core issues of hospital hygiene include:
                        1. Time pressure and work-flow of cleaning staffs
                        2. Content of training program (qualification and knowledge)

                        “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's
                        toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements
                        for business success.” —Tim Brown, president and CEO

                        In 2011, five coaches from d.school (institute of design at Stanford) hosted a two-day workshop
                        in National Tsing Hua University to deliver the concept of Design Thinking. By these five
                        processes: Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, we learn Design thinking has come to be
                        defined as combining empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of
                        insights and solutions, and rationality in analyzing and fitting various solutions to the
                        problem context.
