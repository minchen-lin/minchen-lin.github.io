                <p>
                    In order to provide a reliable and positive work environment, we designed this system to deploy ultimate surveillance coverage,
                    helping security guards and managers to monitor and protect property of the company.

                <p>
                    Before design this system, we did field study and qualitative research with security guards in company to empathize their needs and pain points.
                    Then we invited stakeholders to join the small workshop to do ideation using value proposition canvas.

                    Those information and resources became nutrients of our design. After several rounds of discussions with each stakeholder and we also gave serious consideration
                    about the costs, time and technical feasibility. This surveillance platform is separated into three parts: Central Control System (PC view & mobile view), Vendor System, and Permission Setting.
                    We put a lot of effort into wireframes design to fulfill every scenario. The logic of flow, the style of interface...each part of our design was done by iterations.

                    We cooperated with deep dive market team to analyze market data, and based on this quantitative result we decided our target audience for qualitative research. In order to realize actual situations and a work process, we visited dozens of animal hospitals from different locations in Taiwan.
                    By interviews, questionnaires and other research methods, we received a lot of valuable and unexpected information.

                    We sorted out that information by affinity diagram and try to unravel real needs and core issues of their daily workflow. Our key finding could be separated into four parts: disease detection, medical treatment, information flow, and hospital environment.

                    Based on these four key findings, we did several rounds of brainstorming. Then we discussed about the input and output of each idea to connect them and generate the comprehensive service.
                    We made the service blueprint to record this completed and thoughtful service. This blueprint is not only showing us the whole picture of our service, but also is really helpful when we use it to communicate with other technical teams.

                    Hospital infections and resistant germs are becoming a serious problem in whole Europe. To fight against it has become a very important issue for the German government. We developed the solution, MediClean, which offers a series of innovative services for improving hospital hygiene.

                    In order to get the big picture of the working scenario in the hospital, at first we spoke to one of the representatives of this industry to understand the role of each part in the medical system. As we expected, a cleaning staff is the important stakeholder.
                    Then we did field research in hospitals of Berlin, Frankfurt and Daun. Based on our research, the core issues of hospital hygiene include:
                    1. Time pressure and work-flow of cleaning staffs
                    2. Content of training program (qualification and knowledge)
                    3. Sense of belonging in team and language boundaries of cleaning staffs

                    Before a brainstorming, we also surveyed existing solutions on the market to make us know technical feasibility. And after several rounds of ideation, we proposed services as below:

                    -- Taipei Maokong Gondola Proposal --<br>
                    Maokong (貓空) is a small hill located in Taipei's Wenshan District, famous for great tea and beautiful views above the city. It's become a popular weekend getaway for stressed out Taipeiers as well as one of the must-see spots in Taipei for foreign visitors. --- TAIWAN EXPLORER

                <p>
                    After field study (interviews, mystery shopper, observation) we found out that Maokong is the hot spot in Taipei, but it’s revisiting rate is really low. The most valuable thing there: Tea culture is hard to deliver to tourists. And some stores nearby have no stable revenue sources.

                <p>
                    In order to enhance the willingness of tourists to revisit Maokong, we use gamification to design the scavenger hunt: Missing “Cats” Search!
                    We designed 5 stories (5 routes in Maokong, and cats are hided in the route). Different stories suit different kinds of participants, e.g., Family, couple, or students.

                    At first, participants will receive the brochure (includes all routes we designed), and then they can choose which story they want to join. By following the route, they would learn more about tee culture and have chances to know special stores there (there are coupons in the brochure too). After they finish their task, they will receive our secret presents.

                    Nowadays more and more people are too busy to ignore their body’s condition, especially students who are not living at home. On the other hand, for this type of students there is a distance between them and their family. We offer, therefore, opportunities that being healthy and building the positive family connection.

                    In 2011, five coaches from d.school (institute of design at Stanford) hosted a two-day workshop in National Tsing Hua University to deliver the concept of Design Thinking. By these five processes: Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, we learn Design thinking has come to be defined as combining empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of insights and solutions, and rationality in analyzing and fitting various solutions to the problem context.
